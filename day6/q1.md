### Explanation:

**Test case 11:** The office is 11 km away. Thus, to go to the office and come back home, Chef has to walk 22 kms in a day. In a week with 55 working days, Chef has to travel 2⋅5=102⋅5=10 kms in total.

**Test case 22:** The office is 33 kms away. Thus, to go to the office and come back home, Chef has to walk 66 kms in a day. In a week with 55 working days, Chef has to travel 6⋅5=306⋅5=30 kms in total.

**Test case 33:** The office is 77 kms away. Thus, to go to the office and come back home, Chef has to walk 1414 kms in a day. In a week with 55 working days, Chef has to travel 14⋅5=7014⋅5=70 kms in total.

**Test case 44:** The office is 1010 kms away. Thus, to go to the office and come back home, Chef has to walk 2020 kms in a day. In a week with 55 working days, Chef has to travel 20⋅5=10020⋅5=100 kms in total.
