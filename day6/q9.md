### 400M Race

Alice, Bob, and Charlie participated in a 400400-metre race.  
The time taken by Alice, Bob, and Charlie to complete the race was X,Y,X,Y, and ZZ seconds respectively. Note that X,Y,X,Y, and ZZ are **distinct**.

Determine the person having the highest average speed in the race.

### Input Format

-   The first line of input will contain a single integer TT, denoting the number of test cases.
-   Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
    -   The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers X,Y,X,Y, and ZZ — the time taken by Alice, Bob, and Charlie to complete the race.

### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line:

-   `ALICE`, if Alice had the highest average speed.
-   `BOB`, if Bob had the highest average speed.
-   `CHARLIE`, if Charlie had the highest average speed.

Note that you may print each character in uppercase or lowercase. For example, the strings `BOB`, `bob`, `Bob`, and `BoB` are all considered identical.

### Constraints

-   1≤T≤10001≤T≤1000
-   1≤X,Y,Z≤1001≤X,Y,Z≤100
-   X,Y,X,Y, and ZZ are distinct.

### Explanation:

**Test case 11:** The time taken by the three participants to complete a 400400 metre race was 1,2,1,2, and 88 respectively. Thus, their respective speeds were 4001=400,4002=200,1400​=400,2400​=200, and 4008=508400​=50 metres per second respectively.

Thus, Alice has the maximum speed.

**Test case 22:** The time taken by the three participants to complete a 400400 metre race was 4,100,4,100, and 11 respectively. Thus, their respective speeds were 4004=100,400100=4,4400​=100,100400​=4, and 4001=4001400​=400 metres per second respectively.

Thus, Charlie has the maximum speed.

**Test case 33:** Since Bob takes the minimum time to complete the race, he has the maximum average speed.
